## 1. Journey of Coding 🚀

Welcome to my "Journey of Coding"! 📚 This is like my special diary where I write about all the fun things I'm learning in the world of coding. Just like you have a storybook, this is my story of how I'm exploring and discovering new things in the exciting world of computers.

## 2. About Projects 💻

In my coding journey, I'm working on a special project called "MyFirst." It's like a collection of mini-projects where I get to try out cool ideas and make things with computer codes. Right now, I'm focusing on creating a login screen using a language called Python. It's a bit like creating a secret door where you can enter your information. I think it's going to be really awesome!
